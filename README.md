Food Inspections
================

This is a simple RubyMotion iOS app to display some food inspections using the 
API provided by [Nebraska Food Inspections](http://foodinspections.opennebraska.io).

Instructions
------------
1. Purchase and install [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com)
2. Clone the source, cd to the appropriate directory
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `rake pod:install`
5. Run `rake`
6. Enjoy!

Pay?!
-----
Yes, RubyMotion costs money. I'm using it on another project, so this is an application I'm using 
to learn RM and some associated libraries. I've heard rumors of an Objective-C FI application in 
the works, though! ;)

Limitations
-----------
This is a work in progress. Right now, the Cities tab ([HomeScreen](https://github.com/rnelson/fi-ios/blob/master/app/screens/home_screen.rb)) 
is just an empty black space and nothing happens when you move the map around.
